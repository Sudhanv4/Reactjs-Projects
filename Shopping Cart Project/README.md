# Shopping Cart Project

This is a shopping cart application built with React.js that allows users to add items to their cart and view the selected items along with the total number of items and the total price. The application consists of two pages: the home page and the cart page.

## Home Page

The home page displays a list of available items that users can add to their cart. Each item includes a name, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. Users can click the "Add to Cart" button to add the item to their cart.

## Cart Page

The cart page shows a summary of the items that have been added to the cart. It displays the selected items along with their names, an option to remove, and individual prices. Additionally, the page provides information on the total number of items in the cart and the total price of all the items combined. A dummy "Checkout" button is also included.
